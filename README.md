Magopie uses gomobile for Android support.

The server component of Magopie does the heavy lifting, taking user input search terms, querying various site feeds, and returning results to the client component. The user provides the client component with a selection, which is communicated to the server component for retrieval.

The client component is a user-friendly interface that communicates with the server component through a robust API.
